Here goes the list that will be never ending and in no particular order

:smiley: Gone with the Wind
come on! you knew that would be the first one on my list! I remember travelling through Europe (in the pre-Kindle days where all three of us brought along HUGE books so that we could read them and swap) I brought this one and my mom had In Pursuit of the Green Dragon. My fondest memory is of sitting on the train as it was pulling out of the Naples train station and Mama looked over at me as I was bawling my eyes out "Melanie dying?" she asked?

:grinning: Ok, if Gone with the Wind is first you KNOW that Dragonfly in Amber has to be second! :wink: Papa got us each a book for Christmas (you know as a vehicle to put crisp dollar bills in) I got a sucky one but D got Dragonfly and as she was reading it, she thought it was 'pretty good'

:rofl: Faking it- because it had a great cover and it was pretty funny! Get your mind out of the gutter, it was about an art imposter!
